This Python project aims to create an interactive calculator using the Tkinter library, which comes pre-installed with Python. The project involves creating a proper GUI window, defining the Tk() class, and defining the title, geometry, and resizable methods. The Tkinter library is used to manipulate the text in the Label, Entry, or OptionMen1u widgets. The Label widget displays static text, while the Entry widget is used to input text. The master and font attributes are the same as in Labels.

The Justify attribute determines the text's starting point, while the width and state attributes determine the widget's width. The textvariable attribute assigns the text to a StringVar variable's values. The place() method is used to place the widget on the window, and the x, y attributes specify the horizontal and vertical offsets.

The op portion creates functions.add_text() function, which adds the text to the button pressed. The func() function is used to define a function 'func' that takes an argument 'arg' of the type 'type.'

The submit() function calculates and prints the result of the entry widget's input. The get() method fetches the text from the Entry and StringVar classes, while the set() method overrides all text in the StringVar object and replaces it with the text presented to it as an argument. The evaluate() function evaluates the argument provided to it, and the showerror() function displays an error box.

To add buttons, the Button widget is used, with master, width, font, text, and bg attributes the same as in the Entry, StringVar, and Label classes. The height attribute defines the height of the button, and the command attribute assigns a command to the button. The final OK button is created by setting the final OK button.

In summary, this Python project is a solid start for creating an interactive calculator using the Tkinter library. It is a great starting point for those looking to learn about GUIs and make big calculations without opening the internet.
